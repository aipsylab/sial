# SIAL: Statistical Inference After Learning


## Overview
 
`sial` is a python package for conducting statistical inference on feature importance in machine learning. It supports regressors and classifiers provided by `scikit-learn`. `sial` provides two families of `Inferer` for making inferences: `CIT` for conditional independence test and `RIT` for risk invariance test. `CIT` implements the holdout randomization test (HRT), residual permutation test (RPT), and conditional predictive impact (CPI). On the other hand, `RIT` implements leave-out covariates (LOCO) and plug-in estimation (PIE).
